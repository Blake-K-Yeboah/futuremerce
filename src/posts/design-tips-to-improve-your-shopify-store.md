The design of your shopify store has a vital impact on your store’s layout.

Lets take a look at some simple design tips that can boost your conversion rate and improve your user experience.

### Simplicity is key

Utlising a simple design in your ecommerce store is generall much better than overcomplicating it.

You don’t want to confuse your users by having an excessive amount of elements on the page.

The more random elements you have (like popups, banner ads, and more popups), the worst user experience you are delivering.

This doesn’t mean you should include any other elements, however it important to look at your site from a customer’s point of view and make sure they won’t get distracted from your key message.

### Add social proof

Adding social proof is a very simple way to increase your design’s effectiveness and improve your conversion rate.

This can done by adding testimonials from real customers demonstrating your product’s effectiveness.

You can also add customer reviews to your products so new users feel more comfortable purchasing from your store.

Adding social proof adds trust and is usually fairly simple to implement thanks to the large amount of third-party reviews like trustpilot.

### Make it easy to navigate

Having a clear, easy to use navigation bar is vital to your store’s design.

It should be easy for users to find what they are looking for, they shouldn’t have to dig through 5 different menus and pages to get where they need to be.

Navigation is not just limited to your main navigation bar, its also important to have useful sub categories.

For example, on a clothes category page, having links to specific sub categories like t-shirts, pants, etc can make it much easier for the user to find what they are looking for.

### Make it responsive
