Another way you can start converting more users, is by adding CVPs to various vital parts of your store.

CVPs are your value propositions - essentially reinforcing why a user should purchase from you and how it will help them.

Placing cvps near add to cart buttons, checkout buttons, above the fold on the homepage and other important place can help boost your conversion rate by motivating the user to make a purchase.

When determining your CVPs, its important to view your store from a potential customer’s point of view and ask yourself:

Every store should be A/B testing, it allows you to gain further insights into your customers and determine how you can improve your conversions.
