Connecting your store‚Äôs code to GitHub can have many benefits.

For one, your store will have version control meaning it very easy to keep track of changing and revert back to old versions in case anything goes wrong.

Additionally, it can make setting up staging environments easier especially when you want to publish changes live.

It also improved your developer experience significantly, by improving collaboration and making it easier to track who‚Äôs working on what.

With these benefits in mind, let take a look at how easy it is to setup.

### Setup GitHub account and repository

If you don‚Äôt already have a GitHub account, you‚Äôre going to need to create one.

Once you‚Äôve setup your account, create a repository dedicated to your store. This is where your code will go.

Once you‚Äôve setup your repository, you need to export your currently live theme and upload the code to your GitHub repo.

With the repository setup, you can now head over to your Shopify dashboard to setup the connection.

### Connect Shopify theme to GitHub

If you head over to your themes, you‚Äôll want to add a new theme.

Click on the add theme button, this should open a dropdown with ‚ÄúConnect from GitHub‚Äù as an option.

After following the prompts, you should be able to link the new theme to your GitHub repository you previously created.

You‚Äôve now connected your theme to GitHub üôÇ

You‚Äôll want to do a quick test through the preview mode to ensure the theme displays correctly and then you‚Äôre ready to set it live.

### Branch Structure

There are many different ways of structuring your repository for future ease of development.

We‚Äôd recommend three branches:

-   **Master** - This is your live production branch
-   **Staging** - This is your staging branch, use it to test new features prior to going live.
-   **Feature branches** - This is optional, however it can helpful to use a seperate branch for building out each feature (especially, if you‚Äôve got multiple developers working at the same time)

Thanks to version control, its a very simple process to merge branches, and they will automatically update in your shopify themes.
